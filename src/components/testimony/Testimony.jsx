I wasn‚Äôt just looking for someone for me, I was looking for someone who would respect my story, my priorities, and my 9 year old son who means the world to me.Find Your Match felt different right away. There was a sense of purpose in how everything was set up. It wasn‚Äôt about chasing attention or playing games, it was about real connection, built on values and intention.Through the platform, I met someone who didn‚Äôt just see me as ‚Äòa mom‚Äô or ‚Äòsomeone with baggage‚Äô but as a whole woman with dreams, strength, and a lot of love to give. And the best part? He embraced my child too, with patience and genuine care.Find Your Match gave me more than a match, it gave me hope. Hope that love after hardship isn‚Äôt just possible, it‚Äôs beautiful. For anyone who‚Äôs ever felt like love had passed them by, especially as a parent this is where new chapters begin.",
